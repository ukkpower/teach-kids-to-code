# Teach Kids To Code

This is an HTML5 game built on the Quintus game engine with the purpose of teaching kids to code. Kids will learn Javascript programing through the interaction of code written in the Ace code editor with the game.

The game accepts basic directional commands written in Javascript which moves the player around the level with the aim to collect all flowers.

### TO DO

* The code to iterate over the typed commands from the editor and move the player is functional but overly complicated
* The code performance is very poor, causing too much load on the CPU
